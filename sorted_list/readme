SortedList is composed of Node structs, each containing a previous and next node. (doubly linked list).
SLRemove just iterates the list to find the matching object, and redirects the pointers.
SLInsert simply inserts into the correct spot, assuming a sorted list (which it should be, since its created using SLInsert)
